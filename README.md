# my4clojure
Caveman's solutions for problems from 4clojure.org

This are my first steps with Clojure (or any functional language for that matter), this hopefully explain the stranges of the solution.

One day I might revisit them.

## How to use

I used Lightable (lighttable.com or https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable): Open the corresponing file, hit Ctrl+Shift+Return - all tests must return true.

Every solution has the number of the problem and the name of the problem, so `grep` can be used in order to find file if only the name of the problem is known:

    >>>grep -r -I "Veitch"
    solutions/hard/140.clj:;;; Solution for 140. Veitch, Please!

*NB:* There are not all "Elementary" and "Easy" problems present - those solution where done online.
